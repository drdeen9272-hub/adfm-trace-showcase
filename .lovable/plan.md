### Hero Section — Animated Solution + Mobile Demo
- **Animated flow diagram** showing the Test → Treat → Track → Incentivize loop with icons animating sequentially (mRDT test kit → verified ACT → GPS tracking → airtime reward)
- **Phone silhouette mockup** embedded in the hero, showing a clickable mini-demo of the pharmacist/PPMV WhatsApp flow: sending an mRDT photo → receiving AI interpretation → scratch-and-verify PIN → patient gets airtime reward
- Key stats banner: **4.5B products protected | 35M consumers | 22K mRDTs piloted | 300+ brands | 8,000+ PPMVs**
- CTA buttons: "Explore the Solution" and "See the Dashboard"

### The Challenge Section
- Three cards: Nigeria's malaria burden (27% of global cases), Last-mile access gap (70% of first-contact care at PPMVs), Commodity diversion risk

### How It Works — Interactive Steps
- Clickable step-by-step walkthrough with phone silhouettes:
  1. **TEST** — Pharmacist administers mRDT, sends photo to Sproxil via WhatsApp → AI interprets result
  2. **TREAT** — Patient purchases verified ACT, scratches PIN, texts to verify authenticity → confirmation SMS
  3. **TRACK** — GPS location captured, GS1 batch traceability logged, photo evidence stored
  4. **INCENTIVIZE** — Pharmacist earns ₦150 per verified test-to-treat; patient earns ₦850 airtime for completing outcome survey
